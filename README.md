# UPB Event Check in Mobile App

This repository is for the development of the mobile application for checking into campuse events at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. The project uses Cordova[LINK] to run on both iOS and Android so that anyone with a smartphone can check into events using primarily NFC. The backend of the project is handled through Google Firebase[LINK] using the Firestore and Firebase Storage. 

## Idea
The idea is that students (or faculty) could register as "Going" to an event with relative ease. The data gathered from this could help the university tailor their events to what students overall enjoy. 

Students are also rewarded with "points" for each event they attend, and those points could be required to earn any number of things at events. e.g. VIP status, prizes, upb swag.

## Showcase
Below are some images of the current state of the app.
