<uses-sdk android:minSdkVersion="14" android:targetSdkVersion="20"/>

^^ this <stuff> right here needs to be placed in Android STudio when it errors off (click the "fix now" link when the red text appears)

Apparently, these shenanigans shouldnt exist in the android manifest as of this version, but cordova put its there bc its stubborn af

so, edit the manifest to say this <stuff>, and android studio will just be happy and stop yelling at everyone
