(Append "(DONE)" to beginning of lines when tasks complete)
Current (4-14-19/3PM): 


//Auth: 
-Need to set (with firebase auth) displayname, profile picture, sending confirm emails (@pitt.edu domain) 
-Ability to edit account information (there is currently an unused button on profile page for this) 
-How to handle lost passwords? 



//Event Check-in: 
-Decide on BT or NFC: 
	-NFC + IOS is tricky, maybe use BT
	-Tie Check-in data to events on eventCreation, maybe tie to eventCreator's Phone (they need to be at the event) 
----BT: 
	-Maybe could tie to eventCreator's device BT ID, have users connect and assign points based on initial connect, and time spent at event 
----NFC: 
	-Tag's NAME could be written based on UID of eventCreator and DATA could be written based on eventID(from firestore), event attendance could be sent to firestore under a new collection/doc (foreach event)

-Points system?: Need to figure out what works best and maybe base our attendance system from that, example: NFC only allows for single check-in, bluetooth allows for continuous checking for event attend time



//Event Creation: 
-Need a button (on profile) to return "My events" (created by currentUser) and be able to modify, delete events
-Events are currently listed in no order on the events page, need to sort by soonest occuring event 
-Events need a start and end time, (sorted by start time soonest on events page), after end time, events will not appear on events page (but still exist in firestore) 



//UIDesign: (Not immidiate) 
-Navbar needs centered better (Alex tried and failed :-) ) 
-Dark theme/ light theme user choice in app: requires a toggle in Bootstrap-3 classes (should be easy), and some custom css(hard) <-- This isnt an immidiate need 
-Need a general theme (All buttons, navbars, screens matching) --> Maybe use Cathedral blue theme/Panther Gold variations (Start with the official pitt colors, then variate blues or golds to create a cool theme) 
-Need backgrounds for pages other than main page (not all same pic, but a theme, so main page is welcome theme, app pages share a theme, etc) 


//Testing: (Not immidiate) 
-Need to test BT (if used) P2P with a registered event device, and a event atendee device (Android)
