//Events: 
-Sorting on app page output (by time) 
-Printing better looking event tiles (less detail/remove GMT-x time from output)

-edit events button (not needed if we dont have time tho) 

//Profile: 
-Add feature to set a profile picture from phone (by clicking on the profile picture placeholder) (Also optional based on time)

//General CSS:
